# Changing Viewport size and position 

- in function making the display, change init value of `idxScreenCol` 
- change loop boundaries in function drawing images
- adapt fov and number of  slice with procedure below.

TBD: changing height of viewport. ()



# Changing FOV and Number of Slices

- change value of constant `NUMBER_OF_SLICE` in `raycast.c`
- change loop boundaries in function drawin images
- regénérer les tables `tabRayAngles`, `tabAngle2Col` et `unfish` with script `precalRayAngle.py`
